1. Introduction                                                *QFEnter-intro*

QFEnter allows you to open a Quickfix item in a window you choose.
You can choose the window by giving it a focus just before jumping to Quickfix window.

Some of default opening methods are quite inconvenient,

- You cannot select a window in which a file is opened when you press `<Enter>` in Quickfix.  

  > Hitting the <Enter> key or double-clicking the mouse on a line has the same effect. 
    The file containing the error is opened **in the window above the quickfix window**.  
    `from :help quickfix` 

  It is inconsistent with other Quickfix commands like `:cnext` and `:cprev` 
  which open a file in a previously focused window.

- You also cannot specify the window when you use `Ctrl-W <Enter>`, 
because Vim always create a new horizontal split window above Quickfix window and 
open a file in it.
There is even no command for 'open in a new vertical split window'.

They are confusing and bothers me every time, so I wrote a simple plugin 
to make up for these weak points.
It's name comes from the most basic way to open a file from Quickfix window 
- the `<Enter>` key.

2. Usage                                                       *QFEnter-usage*

In |Quickfix| window,

<Enter>, <2-LeftMouse>  
Open a file under cursor in a previously focused window. 
(<2-LeftMouse> means a left mouse button double click.)

<Leader><Enter>
Open a file under cursor in a new vertical split from a previously focused window.

<Leader><Space>
Open a file under cursor in a new horizontal split from a previously focused window.

<Leader><Tab>
Open a file under cursor in a new tab.
Quickfix window is automatically opened in the new tab to help you open other Quickfix items.

You can change the key mappings in your .vimrc (see |QFEnter-options|).

3. Options                                                   *QFEnter-options*

|QFEnter| mappings are enabled only in |Quickfix| window.

*g:qfenter_open_map*
Key mappings to open a file under cursor in a previously focused window. 
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_open_map = ['<CR>', '<2-LeftMouse>']
<

*g:qfenter_vopen_map*
Key mappings to open a file under cursor in a new vertical split from a previously
focused window.
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_vopen_map = ['<Leader><CR>']
<

*g:qfenter_hopen_map*
Key mappings to open a file under cursor in a new horizontal split from a previously 
focused window.
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_hopen_map = ['<Leader><Space>']
<

*g:qfenter_topen_map*
Key mappings to open a file under cursor in a new tab.
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_topen_map = ['<Leader><Tab>']
<

*g:qfenter_cc_cmd*
QFEnter internally uses |:cc| command.
If you're using your custom "cc" command instead of vim's default |:cc|, you
can register it by setting this option and make QFEnter use it.
The option should have "##" which is converted to the line number later.
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_cc_cmd = '##cc'
<

*g:qfenter_enable_autoquickfix*
Enable or disable automatic opening of Quickfix window when 'open in a new
tab' command is executed.
Quickfix window is automatically opened in the new tab to help you open other Quickfix items.
If enabled, Quickfix window is automatically opened in the new tab with its
original size, view and position. (not correctly, but smartly determined)
Default: >
	let g:qfenter_enable_autoquickfix = 1
<
